The SPP 2363, entitled "Use and Development of Machine Learning for Molecular Applications - Molecular Machine Learning", is an interdisciplinary and collaborative Priority Program funded by the DFG. The goals of the program include the development of new molecular representations, the establishment of machine learning as a tool for theoretical and organic chemistry, and the application of machine learning for medicinal chemistry and drug design. These objectives will be based on the generation and evaluation of high quality data sets and the utilization and development of modern and explainable machine learning algorithms.
